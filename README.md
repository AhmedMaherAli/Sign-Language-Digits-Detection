# Sign-Language-Digits-Detection

#To run this proect:
-You need to instal keras and sk-learn, running it on google colab is preferable.

#Description
-In this project i use Dence Neural Network to make the detection process, 
-I made 4 models and after each one calculate the acuracy to see which model works better.
-The first two i uses the images data set as gray images one of them runs on 3 layers and the other runs on 6 layers.
-The other two i uses the images as RGB one model with 3 layers and the other runs on 6 layers.
